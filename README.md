# NOAH FE Template

## Set up

- Need to ensure you have everything on your machine
- Install [node](https://nodejs.org/download/) and ensure npm is in your system path
- Run `npm install` to install everything (might need sudo)

## Let's develop

- Run `npm run start` to watch for changes to project files and initialise a browser-sync server
- Run `npm run build` to build files and put everything into "dist" folder which can be deployed to production server.
- The 'dist' folder is automatically created when build command is run
